# OOPDeepLearningCPP; A horrible way to do deep learning
Udacity Capstone Project for the C++ nanodegree. In this project, I have implemented a multilayer perceptron for MNIST image classification. Contrary to normal solutions implemented with tensors and matrix algebra, in my solution each node is a unique object.

## Motivation (can be skipped)
My very first deep neural network was a multilayer perceptron implemented in similarly to this repo, but then in Python. Training a network was horribly slow as multiplications were done in vanilla python with for loops and such. Considering the increase in speed with a compiled language like C++, I was motivated to re-implement that old project as my capstone project.


For a better understanding, I can highly recommend [this](https://brilliant.org/wiki/backpropagation/) page of Brilliant:
